# Welcome to the Raspberry Pi Club at Bellingham Technical College!

## Mission:

The Raspberry Pi Club at BTC is dedicated to providing a vibrant platform for students to expand their knowledge and skills in computer science, electronics, and programming using Raspberry Pi boards. Our mission is to foster a collaborative environment where students from diverse backgrounds can come together to explore the vast potential of Raspberry Pi. We aim to provide a platform for hands-on learning, project development, and knowledge sharing to empower our members in the exciting realm of DIY computing.

## What is Raspberry Pi?
Raspberry Pi is a series of small, affordable single-board computers developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, a UK-based charity organization. These credit card-sized computers are designed to promote the teaching of basic computer science and programming in schools and developing countries, as well as to enable enthusiasts to explore and experiment with computing and electronics.

### Key features of Raspberry Pi include:

**Affordability**: Raspberry Pi boards are highly affordable, making them accessible to students, hobbyists, and professionals alike.

**Versatility**: Despite their small size, Raspberry Pi boards are powerful and versatile, capable of performing a wide range of tasks, from basic computing to complex projects involving electronics, robotics, and IoT (Internet of Things) applications.

**Expandability**: Raspberry Pi boards come with a variety of ports and interfaces, including USB, HDMI, GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output), and more, allowing users to connect peripherals and expand functionality as needed.

**Community Support**: The Raspberry Pi community is vast and active, providing a wealth of resources, tutorials, and projects for users to learn from and contribute to.

**Educational Value**: Raspberry Pi has become a popular tool in education, empowering students to learn programming, electronics, and computer science concepts in a hands-on and engaging way.

Whether you're a student looking to learn programming, an electronics enthusiast interested in building innovative projects, or a professional seeking a flexible and affordable computing platform, Raspberry Pi offers endless possibilities for exploration and creativity.

## What We Do
**Workshops**
Our club organizes regular workshops where members can immerse themselves in various Raspberry Pi projects. Led by experienced members or guest speakers, these workshops cover a wide range of topics, including setting up Pi-Holes, building custom routers, developing games, and more. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced enthusiast, our workshops offer opportunities to learn new skills, tackle challenging projects, and share knowledge with fellow members.

**Tech Talks**
We host engaging tech talks featuring guest speakers from industry professionals, academia, and the Raspberry Pi community. These talks cover diverse topics related to Raspberry Pi, electronics, programming languages, IoT (Internet of Things), and emerging technologies. Through these talks, members gain valuable insights, learn about cutting-edge developments, and expand their understanding of the limitless possibilities offered by Raspberry Pi.

**Social Events**
In addition to our technical activities, we also organize fun and engaging social events to foster camaraderie and friendship among our members. These events include game nights, movie screenings, pizza parties, and outdoor activities. Social events provide opportunities for members to relax, unwind, and connect with like-minded peers outside of the classroom or workshop setting, strengthening bonds and building lasting friendships within the Raspberry Pi community.
